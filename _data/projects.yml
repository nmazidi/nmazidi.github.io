- project: Automatic Quantification of Breast Arterial Calcification in Mammographic Images
  role: Python (NumPy, SciPy)&#44; TensorFlow, ImageJ
  duration: 2017
  url: "https://github.com/nmazidi/MammoCalcifications"
  description: This project focuses on developing a system that serves as an aide to Radiologists when diagnosing breast arterial calcifications in women with the use of Mammography. This system will aim to automatically classify a given Mammogram image with respect it's overall calcification severity. Thus providing an addition use case for Mammography with no additional cost.
